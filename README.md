Features
1.	Automated Testing: Validates car details like make, model, and value for a given registration.
2.	Data-Driven Testing: Uses input data from a CSV file or an examples table in the feature file.
3.	Maintainable Code: Implements the Page Object Model (POM) for structured and reusable code.
4.	Assertions: Ensures the fetched details match the expected data with assertions

Prerequisites
1.	Install Python (version 3.7+ recommended).
2.	Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install behave selenium pandas
3.	Download the appropriate browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

Usage
1. Add Input Data
•	Add registration numbers in data/input.csv or directly in the feature file as examples:
registration
ABC123
XYZ789
2. Define Expected Output
•	Add the expected car details in data/expected_output.csv:
registration,make,model,value
ABC123,Toyota,Corolla,15000
XYZ789,Honda,Civic,18000
3. Update Locators
•	In pages/car_page.py, replace placeholder locators (By.ID, etc.) with actual locators from the target website.
4. Run Tests
•	Use the provided test runner to execute the framework:
python run_tests.py
 
How It Works
1.	BDD Feature:
o	The feature file (car_valuation.feature) defines test scenarios for validating car details.
2.	Step Definitions:
o	The steps in car_steps.py implement the logic to:
	Navigate to the website.
	Input the registration.
	Fetch and validate car details.
3.	Page Object Model:
o	The CarPage class in car_page.py handles all interactions with the website.
4.	Validation:
o	Fetched details are compared with the expected output using assertions.
 
Customizations
1.	Website URL:
o	Update the URL in CarPage.URL.
2.	Browser Driver:
o	Modify CarPage.__init__ to use a different browser if required (e.g., Firefox).
3.	Dynamic Locators:
o	Adjust locators in fetch_car_details() to match the website structure.
4.	Logging:
o	Add logging for better test reporting (optional).
 
Example Feature File
Feature: Car Valuation Check

  Scenario Outline: Validate car details using registration number
    Given I navigate to the car valuation website
    When I search for a car with registration "<registration>"
    Then the car details should match the expected values

    Examples:
      | registration |Mileage |
      | ABC123       | 20220  |
      | XYZ789       | 20000  |
 
Reporting
Behave provides built-in reporting via the terminal. To generate HTML reports, use plugins like allure-behave:
1.	Install Allure:
pip install allure-behave
2.	Generate Report:
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports/
allure serve reports/
 
Troubleshooting
•	Browser Driver Issues: Ensure the browser driver is compatible with the browser version.
•	Locators Not Found: Update locators in car_page.py to match the website.
•	Data Mismatch: Ensure expected_output.csv is up-to-date with the latest values.
 
Future Enhancements
1.	Add support for parallel execution.
2.	Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.	Enhance reporting with detailed logs.
